In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./salty_egg.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Game Dark Souls","description":"Hello Some Time...","tags":["game","dark-souls"],"featuredImage":{"publicURL":"/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a.jpg"},"date":"May 01, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/dark-souls.1/dark-souls.3/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/dark-souls.1/dark-souls.5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Game Dark Souls","tags":["game","dark-souls"]}}}}
